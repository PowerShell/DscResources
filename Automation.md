# Automation in DSC Resource Kit

Some areas of the DSC Resource Kit have been automated, and other need further
automation.

## Labels

Labels are used in the issue and pull request workflow to show the current state.
When a issue or pull request add or remove a label an action could occur,
for example adding an automated comment.

These are the labels currently used by the resource modules in the DSC Resource
Kit. Some of these labels are meant to be used with future automation.

>The script [DscResourceKit-Labels](https://gist.github.com/johlju/f83f99787029a6b5d65cfd6844cf9449) that is provided
>by the community can be used to update the labels in your own repository.
