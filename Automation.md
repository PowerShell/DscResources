# Automation in DSC Resource Kit

Some areas and workflows of the DSC Resource Kit are automated, and future
automation will cover other areas. This document has both information around
present automations, and potential future automations.

## Labels

Labels are being used in the issue and pull request workflows to show the current
state.
When an issue or pull request add or remove a label an event (action) could occur,
where the event could for example add an automated comment or change assignee.
See [Events](#events) for more information around different events.

These are the labels currently used by the resource modules in the DSC Resource
Kit. Some of these labels are meant to be used with future automation.

Label | Description | Color Hex | Area of usage (PR, Issue) | Comment
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
abandoned | The pull request has been abandoned. | #ffffff White | PR | Used to indicate that the original author of a PR no longer appears to be working on the PR, and the work could be continued by another contributor (as per [Abandoned Pull Requests](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/a923a5f1cda20bd69046095da22c3ba062644922/Maintainers.md#abandoned-pull-requests) and [How to continue working on a pull request when an author (contributor) is unable to complete it](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/GettingStartedWithGitHub.md#how-to-continue-working-on-a-pull-request-when-an-author-contributor-is-unable-to-complete-it)). Maintainer needs to comment why the PR is labelled as abandoned. If the original author continues to work on the issue this label should be removed.
blocking release | The issue or pull request is blocking the next release. Higher priority than label 'High priority'. | #800000 Dark red | Issue, PR | Only needed in modules with a release.

GitHub Help point out to use this and the ‘Help wanted’ tag, see [Helping new contributors find your project with labels](https://help.github.com/articles/helping-new-contributors-find-your-project-with-labels). ***Note:** The label description is missing punctuation because of length restriction in GitHub.*
enhancement | The issue is an enhancement request. | #84b6eb Light blue | Issue |  
external | The issue cannot be resolved within the DSC Resource Kit. | #ffffff White | Issue | Indicates reason for closure. Maintainer needs to comment why the issue/PR was closed.

This label takes precedence over 'Waiting for author response'. This label should *never* be use together with 'Waiting for author response'.

## Events

These are the events that are part of the current workflow for
issues and pull requests. The events are using labels to tell when there is a need
for an action in the workflow.
These events should preferably be automated as far as we can. For now, the events
need to be done manually.
Automating these events are meant to reduce the repetitive work when maintaining
the resources. Not all of these might be a reality.

### Issues

Events found around the issue workflows.
This list should be updated when more repetitive work is found.

Done | Event | Add label | Remove label | Assigned | Comment
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
— | Contributor creates issue | -- | -- | Manually assignment or assigned automatically to all maintainers individually. | *GitHub support confirmed that it is not possible to assign an issue or PR to a team. Neither is it possible for a team to consist of both collaborators and organizational users.*
— | Contributor creates issue for a new resource module submission | **Manual** New module submission | | Entire community, so no assignment on these. | Automated comment linking to the documentation on how, and the requirements, to make a new module submission linking your own resource module to DSC Resource Kit.

This list should be updated when more repetitive work is found.

Done | Event | Add label | Remove label | Assigned | Comment
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --

## GitHub Apps

### Stale

Stale has been added to all repositories in DSC Resource Kit. Stale will not be
enabled (activated) until each repo opt-in by adding a configuration to the
file `.github/stale.yml` in the default branch (normally 'dev').

#### Stale issues

When there has not been activity on an issue for 30 days, the label 'stale' is
added, and a comment will be written to the issue, to remind the community to
resolve the issue if it is still valid.
Any other label, like a "waiting..."-label, 'needs more information', 'question'
or 'discussion' label are kept when the issue is labeled 'stale'.

If there are no further activity within 10 days Stale will close the issue.
When the issue is closed, the 'stale' label will be kept, but any label that are
a Waffle board column will be removed (see [Waffle automation](#waffle)).

If a comment is made, or a label is changed, that counts as activity and the
'Stale' label is removed.

An issue will not be commented on or be closed if the issue is assigned one of
the (work) labels under *exemptLabels* (the last two of the labels are only needed
for the DscResources repository). Neither will it close issues that are part of
a milestone or project. This is just a precaution, because those issues should
have a (work) label assigned too.

#### Stale pull requests (PR)

PR's that are not labeled with 'needs review', 'on hold' or 'waiting for CLA pass'
will be labeled as abandoned after 14 days of inactivity.

>**Note:** Pull requests that are labeled as 'waiting for CLA pass' should be
>closed after 14 days, but this app cannot handle that.

Any other label, like a "waiting..."-label will be kept when the issue is labeled
'abandoned'. If activity is made on the abandoned PR the 'abandoned' label is
removed.

>**Note:** There are currently a bug that prevents the abandoned labeled to be
>remove from the PR.
>This bug is reported here https://github.com/probot/stale/issues/134.

#### Configuration

The below configuration will handle issues and pull request differently. Each
repository can set change the configuration individually.

Example of file `.github/stale.yml` which is in use for all repositories as of
writing.

```yml
# Configuration for probot-stale - https://github.com/probot/stale

limitPerRun: 30

pulls:
  daysUntilStale: 14
  daysUntilClose: false
  exemptProjects: true
  exemptMilestones: true
  staleLabel: abandoned
  exemptLabels:
    - needs review
    - on hold
    - waiting for CLA pass

  markComment: >
    Labeling this pull request (PR) as abandoned since it has gone 14 days or more
    since the last update. An abandoned PR can be continued by another contributor.
    The abandoned label will be removed if work on this PR is taken up again.

issues:
  daysUntilStale: 30
  daysUntilClose: 40
  exemptProjects: true
  exemptMilestones: true
  staleLabel: stale
  exemptLabels:
    - bug
    - enhancement
    - tests
    - documentation
    - resource proposal
    - on hold
    - new module submission
    - module proposal

  markComment: >
    This issue has been automatically marked as stale because
    it has not had activity from the community in the last 30 days. It will be
    closed if no further activity occurs within 10 days. If the issue is labelled
    with any of the work labels (e.g bug, enhancement, documentation, or tests)
    then the issue will not auto-close.

  closeComment: >
    This issue has been automatically closed because it is has not had activity
    from the community in the last 40 days.
```

## GitHub Integration

### Waffle

DSC Resource Kit have a [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/powershell/dscresources)
which is awesome to keep track of everything that is going on in the repositories
of the DSC Resource Kit.

In the Waffle board it is possible to drag issue/PR to different columns and that
way automatically label them. It is the same as anyone labeling the
issue or PR directly, and the issue or PR will move to the new Waffle board column
automatically, so not an automation per say. Although, it is one difference if
the Waffle board or user changes a label. There is a property `isBot` that is
set to `true` in the returned payload (for webhooks) if there was a bot that did
the change. That can affect how other bot threats the label change if it is done
by the Waffle board or done manually by the user.

There is some automation that is done by thanks to the Waffle board.
When an issue is closed, and the issue is in any (one or more) of the Waffle board
columns (except for the *Backlog* or *Done* column), the assigned label to that
column is removed. Same happens when a PR is merged or closed.

For example, if an issue is in the *Help Wanted* column on the Waffle board,
then the issue will have the label *help wanted* assigned. If the issue is closed,
the *help wanted* label will be removed (and the issue will be moved to the
"Closed"-column in the Waffle board).
Another example is if a pull request (PR) has 'needs review' label assigned, the
pull request (PR) will be in the "Needs review"-column of the Waffle board. When
the pull request (PR) is merged (or closed) the 'needs review' label will be
removed from the pull request (PR) (and the issue will be moved to the
"Closed"-column in the Waffle board).
