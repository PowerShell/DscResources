Discussed process for "community-supported" tags.

General consensus was to keep going on the path we're on - allow links to external repos for "Community-supported" modules

Discuss in this call new additions.

Open items for Zach:
* Talk to gallery team about potentially gatekeeping tags so only "approved" modules can use the "community-supported" tags.
* Can we use change tracking in a way to keep this stuff audited responsibly?
* What if a resource gets approved and then it gets code added to it?
