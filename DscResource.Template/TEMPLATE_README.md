# TEMPLATE README

This is a template that can be used as a baseline for starting your own
repository containing a DSC resource module.

## Using the template

The template is used by copying all the folder and files under the folder
[DscResource.Template](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/DscResource.Template)
to the root of your new repository.
After that you need to go through each file and update the information and code.

Some services should be connected to the new repository, see
[Adding services to your repository](#adding-services-to-your-repository).

It is suggested that you add a LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md file to your repository
as well. You should have been asked to add a license if you created the repository
on GitHub (but can also be added after).

#### .codecov.yml

This is the settings file for the Codecov service. This contains the settings
for the DSC Resource Kit.
No changes are needed for this file.

#### .gitattributes

This is the settings file for git. This file is used by DSC Resource Kit to
always check out the files with CRLF regardless of how `git` is configured.
It must be present for the automatic publishing of examples to PowerShell Gallery
to work (opt-in in the test framework, DscResource.Tests).
No changes are needed for this file.

#### .gitignore

This file is used by git to ignore certain files or folders so that that they do
not get committed to the repository. This file is used by the DSC Resource Kit
to ignore the folder DscResource.Tests, which is automatically cloned by the unit
and integration tests when using the unit and integration test templates.
No changes are needed for this file.

#### .MetaTestOptIn.json

This files controls what tests are opt-in when the test framework is run, for
example when run in AppVeyor.
If some test are opt-out, then the test framework will output the strings to put
into this file. Add those strings to this file to opt-in for those tests.
No changes are needed for this file, unless opt-in to more tests.

#### appveyor.yml

This is the control file for AppVeyor (that runs the CI pipeline). This file
tells AppVeyor how and what to run during the continuous integration process.
If using the automatic publishing of examples, then the API key needs to be
updated, otherwise the environment variable can be removed.
No other changes are needed for this file.

#### CHANGELOG.md

This file is used to track changes to the resource module. Update
{ModuleName} to match the name of the resource module, and update the sections
to suit your needs.

#### CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

This file explains the Code of Conduct. This file should be changed to the
code of conduct that you and your contributors are to follow.

#### README.md

This file is used to show information about the repository and the
documentation around the resources in the resource module.

Update:

- {ModuleName} throughout to match the name of the resource module.
- { Description of the module ... } to match the description of your module.
- {token} to your token for AppVeyor.
- Update the section "How to contribute". Can also point to your contributing
  guidelines in a CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Update the section Resources to match your resources.

#### ResourceModule.psd1

Rename this file, replacing 'ResourceModule', with the name of your resource
module.
Replace the content of the properties in this file to match your resource module.
It is important to change the GUID in this file to a new unique GUID for your
module (i.e by running `New-Guid` to get a unique GUID).

#### .github

This folder contains issues templates and pull request template. They are visible
to the user in GitHub when a contributor is submitting an issue (they user can
choose which issue template suits the issue), or when a contributor proposes a
change in a pull request, the pull request template is shown.

#### .vscode

This folder contains settings file for Visual Studio Code. The settings file
is used to simplify formatting and making sure the correct PS Script Analyzer
rules are used.
If Visual Studio Code is not used as the editor, then this folder is not
necessary. No changes are needed for the files in this folder.

#### DSCResources

This folder contains the actual resource(s) in this resource module.

#### Modules

This folder is meant to contain PowerShell modules that holds helper functions
used by more than one resource. Using this folder for helper functions make sure
the test framework finds the module files and shows coverage for the code.

#### Examples

This folder contains the examples of using the resources. These example can
be published automatically to PowerShell Gallery (if opt-in).

#### Tests

This folder holds unit tests and integration tests used to test the resources
and helper function in this resource module.

##### Integration

This folder should contain the integration tests. An integration test is a test
that make actual changes to the environment to test the functionality.

By separating integration tests from the unit tests, the unit test can be run
without the fear that a test could potentially make destructive
changes to the environment.

##### Unit

This folder should contain the unit tests. A unit test is a test
that _does not_ make changes to the environment. Instead, a unit test mocks
the command that would make the actual change, making it possible to test
functionality in several code paths.
Unit tests should be safe to run on any environment.

By separating integration tests from the unit tests, the unit test can be run
without the fear that a test could potentially make destructive
changes to the environment.

## Adding services to your repository

The template assumes some free services (for open source projects on GitHub) are
used. You should connect to the services to get the most out of the test framework.

- **AppVeyor** - to run automated tests
- **Codecov** - to get code coverage on PR's and project.
- **PowerShell Gallery** - to publish examples automatically.

## Plaster

There is also a community project to create a Plaster template for generating
a baseline for a DSC resource module. Please see the GitHub repository
[NewDscHighQualityResourceModule](https://github.com/bgelens/NewDscHighQualityResourceModule)
for more information.
