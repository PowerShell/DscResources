# How to perform a resource module submission

An owner of a resource module may make a new resource module submission by adding
the repository as a submodule to the list of resource modules under
[DscResources](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/DscResources).

Prior to listing in DSC Resource repository under [DscResources](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/DscResources)

- The repository must pass the
  [Quality Governance](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Naming.md#quality-governance).
- The community accepts, at a community call, that a resource module follows the
  guidelines set out for a
  [High Quality Resource Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Naming.md#high-quality-resource-module).

## First step

When you think your resource module is ready for listing in DSC Resource Kit,
then the first step is to create a new issue using the *New resource module submission* issue
template. It should include all the information needed to make a successful
resource module submission (including the above information).

>***Note:** You can look at the template to get the information without submitting
an issue.*

## Support for the new resource module submission

The maintainer (owner) of the resource module, and the community, will contribute
and support the resource module (in the owners repository) on a voluntary
basis. If not otherwise mentioned in the resource module's documentation
[it should be considered unsupported](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Supportability.md#who-provides-support-for-the-technologies-managed-by-dsc).
