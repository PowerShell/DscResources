## Support

Please review the DSC Resource Kit support guidelines [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/Supportability.md).

## New to PowerShell DSC

Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a declarative management platform in PowerShell
to configure, deploy, and manage systems.
If you are new to DSC, configurations, or resources, you can learn more about
them [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview).

## Resource Module Source Code

The DSC Resource Kit currently contains more than 55 different resource modules.

You can find the source code of a resource module by visiting its GitHub page at:

`https://github.com/PowerShell/< module name >`

For example, for the CertificateDsc module, go to:

`https://github.com/PowerShell/CertificateDsc`

All DSC resource modules are also listed as submodules of this repository (DscResources)
in the [xDscResources folder](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/xDscResources)
or [DscResources folder](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/DscResources).
Read about the differences in naming under the
[High Quality Resource Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Naming.md#high-quality-resource-module)
section.

To download the released source code for **all** DSC resource modules, clone this
repository with this git command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources.git --recursive
```

Alternatively, to download just the documentation provided in this repository, clone
this repository with this git command:

```shell

## Released DSC Resource Modules

To see a list of **all** released DSC Resource Kit modules, go to the
[PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and display
[all modules tagged as DSCResourceKit](http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=Tags%3A%22DSCResourceKit%22).

To find a **specific** module, enter the module's name in the search box in the
upper right corner of the PowerShell Gallery or go directly to its URL:
http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/< module name >
For example:
http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xWebAdministration

We recommend that you use PowerShellGet to install DSC resource modules:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name < module name >
```

For example:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name xWebAdministration
```

To update all previously installed modules at once, open an elevated PowerShell
prompt and use this command:

```powershell
Update-Module
```

After installing modules, you can discover all DSC resources available to your
local system with this command:

```powershell
Get-DscResource
```
