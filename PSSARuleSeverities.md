# DSC Resource Kit PSSA Rule Severities

These are the PS Script Analyzer rules that must be used for DSC resources in
DSC Resource Kit.

In tests and examples the PS Script Analyzer rules may be suppressed on a
case-by-case basis (up to the community and the maintainer).

These rules are also available as an
[analyzer rules settings file](DscResource.Template/.vscode/analyzersettings.psd1)
in the DscResource.Template, used together with the Visual Studio Code settings
file, it detects if any code is not compliant with these rules.
To manually run PS Script Analyzer using the analyzer rules settings files,
once the .psd1 file is copied from the template, run the following.

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Settings '.vscode\analyzersettings.psd1'
```

## Rules

### Must Pass

All DSC Resources must pass these rules.
They are not allowed to be suppressed.

| Rule Name | PSSA Type | Why Error? |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| [PSAvoidDefaultValueForMandatoryParameter](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidDefaultValueForMandatoryParameter.md) | Warning | This indicates an incorrect use of PowerShell. Default mandatory parameters will be overwritten by the user. |
| [PSAvoidDefaultValueSwitchParameter](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidDefaultValueSwitchParameter.md) | Warning | This indicates an incorrect use of PowerShell. Switch parameters should always default to 'not provided'. |
| [PSAvoidInvokingEmptyMembers](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidInvokingEmptyMembers.md) | Warning | Extra empty members can make code confusing and messy. |
| [PSAvoidNullOrEmptyHelpMessageAttribute](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidNullOrEmptyHelpMessageAttribute.md) | Warning | This indicates an incorrect use of PowerShell. The HelpMessage attribute should not be provided if it is null or empty. |
| [PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingCmdletAliases.md) | Warning | Alias's may change hence the presence of an alias makes code potentially unstable. The base cmdlet should be used instead. |
| [PSAvoidUsingComputerNameHardcoded](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingComputerNameHardcoded.md) | Error | Hard-coding the computer name reveals sensitive system information. In addition, DSC Resources should be able to run on computers with any name. |
| [PSAvoidUsingDeprecatedManifestFields](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingDeprecatedManifestFields.md) | Warning | All manifests should stay updated with the correct manifest fields. |
| [PSAvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock.md) | Warning | This indicates an incorrect use of PowerShell. Catch blocks should not be provided if empty. |
| [PSAvoidUsingInvokeExpression](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingInvokeExpression.md) | Warning | Invoke-Expression is vulnerable to string injection. |
| [PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingPositionalParameters.md) | Info | Named parameters should be used instead. |
| [PSAvoidShouldContinueWithoutForce](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidShouldContinueWithoutForce.md) | Warning | If ShouldContinue is used, it should be used correctly with the Force parameter. |
| [PSAvoidUsingWMICmdlet](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingWMICmdlet.md) | Warning | The author should use CIM cmdlets instead to comply with WSMan standards. |
| [PSAvoidUsingWriteHost](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingWriteHost.md) | Warning | Write-Verbose should be used instead. |
| [PSDSCReturnCorrectTypesForDSCFunctions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCReturnCorrectTypesForDSCFunctions.md) | Info | Required for the resource to work. |
| [PSDSCStandardDSCFunctionsInResource](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCStandardDSCFunctionsInResource.md) | Error | Required for the resource to work. |
| [PSDSCUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC.md) | Error | Required for the resource to work. |
| [PSDSCUseIdenticalParametersForDSC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCUseIdenticalParametersForDSC.md) | Error | Required for the resource to work. |
| [PSMisleadingBacktick](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/MisleadingBacktick.md) | Warning | Extra backticks are not necessary and indicate that the code is not clean. |
| [PSMissingModuleManifestField](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/MissingModuleManifestField.md) | Warning | All manifests should stay updated with the correct manifest fields. |
| [PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/PossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull.md) | Warning | $null should *always* be on the left side of comparisons in PowerShell in case the item you are comparing $null against is an array, may be an array in the future, or turns into an array due to an error. |
| [PSProvideCommentHelp](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/ProvideCommentHelp.md) | Info | All exported functions should be documented with comment help. |
| [PSReservedCmdletChar](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/ReservedCmdletChar.md) | Warning | This indicates that the code won't run. |
| [PSReservedParams](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/ReservedParams.md) | Warning | Reserved params are *reserved*. Don't redefine them. |
| [PSUseApprovedVerbs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseApprovedVerbs.md) | Warning | Authors must follow PowerShell best practices by using only approved verbs. |
| [PSUseCmdletCorrectly](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseCmdletCorrectly.md) | Warning | This indicates that the author did not provide parameters required for a cmdlet. |
| [PSUseOutputTypeCorrectly](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseOutputTypeCorrectly.md) | Info | This ensures that all functions always return the correct types. |

### Flag - Occasionally can be overruled with approval

DSC Resources *should* pass these rules, but there are cases where these rules are allowed to be suppressed.

| Rule Name | PSSA Type | Cases Where Rule Suppression Approved |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| [PSAvoidGlobalVars](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidGlobalVars.md) | Warning | <ul><li> Setting $global:DSCMachineStatus = 1 to trigger a machine reboot. </li></ul> |
| [PSAvoidUsingConvertToSecureStringWithPlainText](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingConvertToSecureStringWithPlainText.md) | Error | <ul><li> Some resources may have outside dependencies that require conversion with plaintext. </li></ul> |
| [PSAvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword.md) | Warning | <ul><li> Some resources may have outside dependencies that require insecure plaintext passwords. </li></ul> |
| [PSAvoidUsingUsernameAndPasswordParams](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/AvoidUsingUsernameAndPasswordParams.md) | Error | <ul><li> The username is a key for the resource. </li></ul> |
| [PSDSCUseVerboseMessageInDSCResource](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCUseVerboseMessageInDSCResource.md) | Info | <ul><li> A helper function is called which in turn calls Write-Verbose. </li></ul> |
| [PSShouldProcess](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/ShouldProcess.md) | Warning | <ul><li> A helper function is called which in turn calls ShouldProcess. </li></ul> |
| [PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments.md) | Warning | <ul><li> The variable is used on the same line as its assignment. </li><li> The variable is an approved global or environment variable. </li></ul> |
| [PSUsePSCredentialType](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UsePSCredentialType.md) | Warning | <ul><li> Some resources may have outside dependencies that require string credentials. </li></ul> |

### Ignore

These rules will not be run on DSC resources and can be ignored.
They do not need to be suppressed.

| Rule Name | PSSA Type | Why Ignored? |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| [PSDSCDscExamplesPresent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCDscExamplesPresent.md) | Info | High quality resources **must** have examples, but this rule doesn't correctly test this. |
| [PSDSCDscTestsPresent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/DSCDscTestsPresent.md) | Info | High quality resources **must** have tests, but this rule doesn't correctly test this. |
| [PSUseBOMForUnicodeEncodedFile](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseBOMForUnicodeEncodedFile.md) | Warning | There is already a test in place to ensure that all files except the mofs are not in Unicode. The mofs must be in ASCII. |
| [PSUseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions.md) | Warning | This will trigger for Set-TargetResource which actually should not have ShouldProcess in this case. DSC Resources need to be able to run remotely without user confirmation or overrides. |
| [PSUseSingularNouns](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseSingularNouns.md) | Warning | Fixing this rule can make function names inaccurate and usually does not result in improved code. |
| [PSUseToExportFieldsInManifest](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseToExportFieldsInManifest.md) | Warning | We currently approve of using '*' for these fields in the module manifests since the exported members are often in flux due to the open source nature of the Resource Kit. |
| [PSUseUTF8EncodingForHelpFile](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/development/RuleDocumentation/UseUTF8EncodingForHelpFile.md) | Warning | DSC Resources do not have help files. |
