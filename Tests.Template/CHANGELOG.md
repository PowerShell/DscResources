# Test Template Change List

Any changes made to the *Tests.Template* files must be added to the appropriate
section in this document.
The version number in the *Tests.Template* header must also be updated to match.
When the templates are used to create or update tests in a DSC Resource the
version number of the template file used must be included.

## integration_template.config.ps1

### Version 1.2.0

* Allows reading the configuration data from a JSON file,
  e.g. integration_template.config.json for real testing scenarios outside of
  the CI ([issue #89](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/issues/89)).

  with `CertificateFile = $env:DscPublicCertificatePath` so the configuration
  can decrypt credentials if needed.

### Version 1.1.0

* Renamed filename of the integration test config template to use the right
  naming convention.
* Change so that 'Configuration' is written with upper 'C'. The name of the

  integration test template.
